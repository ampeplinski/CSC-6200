I used pointers in my function but there is no way to enter into the parameters of the numbers in the array. i tried to use visual studio code to enter in some array numbers as a parameter  but ran into issues. I had to use MSYS2 CLANG 64 to be able to compile the c++ code because the script would not compile correctly using the visual studio code compiler.
